### **Intune Co-Management Setup with SCCM - Detailed Notes**

**Introduction to Co-Management**
- Co-management allows devices to be managed by both SCCM (System Center Configuration Manager) and Microsoft Intune simultaneously.
- Provides a phased approach to modern management while retaining existing SCCM functionality.
- Supports a bridge from on-premise management to cloud management.

**Key Concepts**
- **SCCM (Config Manager)**: Traditional on-premises device management solution.
- **Microsoft Intune**: Cloud-based management solution focused on modern device management.
- **Hybrid Setup**: Uses Intune as a delivery mechanism while SCCM manages content and administration.
- **Mixed Authority**: Transition phase where some devices are managed by SCCM and others by Intune.

**Prerequisites for Co-Management**
1. Config Manager version 1710 or higher.
2. Windows 10 devices (version 1709 or higher).
3. Devices must be Hybrid Azure AD joined.
4. Active SCCM infrastructure.
5. Auto-enrollment in Intune enabled.

**Architecture Overview**
- Windows 10 devices can communicate with both SCCM and Intune.
- SCCM manages devices via on-premises infrastructure.
- Intune manages devices via cloud services.
- SCCM and Intune do not synchronize policies; workloads are directed based on administrator settings.

**Device Management Workloads**
- Workloads define which service manages specific device policies.
- Three primary workloads:
  1. Compliance Policies
  2. Resource Access Policies
  3. Client Applications
- By default, all workloads are managed by SCCM until changed.

**Enrollment Methods for Co-Management**
1. **Manual Enrollment**:
   - Users go to "Access Work or School" in Windows settings and enroll manually.
2. **Group Policy Enrollment**:
   - Configure group policy for auto-enrollment via Active Directory.
3. **SCCM Console Enrollment**:
   - Enable auto-enrollment in Intune from the SCCM console.

**Enabling Co-Management in SCCM**
1. Navigate to SCCM Console → Administration → Cloud Services → Co-Management.
2. Sign in with Global Administrator credentials.
3. Choose to enable co-management for all devices or a pilot collection.
4. Ensure the SCCM client is installed on devices.
5. Verify Hybrid Azure AD Join status.

**Policy Flow in Co-Management**
1. SCCM discovers the device.
2. Pushes the SCCM client to the device.
3. Device is enrolled to Intune through policy.
4. SCCM and Intune assign policies based on workload settings.
5. Device receives policies from the designated authority (SCCM or Intune).

**Co-Management Capabilities**
- Compliance policies and conditional access can be managed from Intune.
- Application deployments can be managed via SCCM.
- SCCM remains the primary management tool until workloads are shifted to Intune.

**Monitoring and Troubleshooting**
- Logs to monitor:
  - `CCMSetup.log` (Client installation)
  - `PolicyPV.log` (Policy deployment)
  - `CoManagementHandler.log` (Workload transition)
- Use the SCCM console to verify device status and workload assignments.

**Scenarios for Co-Management**
1. **SCCM Managed Devices to Co-Managed**:
   - Default scenario where devices are already under SCCM management and are enrolled in Intune.
2. **Intune Managed Devices to Co-Managed**:
   - Less common scenario where Intune-managed devices receive the SCCM client.

**Advantages of Co-Management**
- Leverage existing SCCM infrastructure while adopting cloud capabilities.
- Phased migration to modern management.
- Conditional access and compliance management through Intune.
- Flexibility in managing workloads.

**Limitations and Considerations**
- Co-management is only supported for Windows 10 devices.
- Requires Hybrid Azure AD Join.
- SCCM and Intune do not synchronize policies.
- Workload conflicts must be managed carefully to avoid policy duplication.

**Steps to Transition Workloads**
1. Identify the workloads to transition (e.g., compliance policies).
2. Set the workload owner (SCCM or Intune) in the SCCM console.
3. Verify device enrollment in both SCCM and Intune.
4. Monitor workload delivery via logs.

**Future of Co-Management**
- Transitioning from SCCM to Intune standalone is encouraged as Microsoft phases out hybrid solutions.
- Co-management serves as an interim solution for organizations adopting cloud-based management.

**Summary**
- Co-management is a powerful approach to modernize device management without abandoning legacy SCCM investments.
- It allows for a gradual transition to cloud-based management while maintaining on-prem capabilities.
- Understanding workloads, prerequisites, and policy flows is essential for successful implementation.

**Key Logs for Troubleshooting**
- `CCMSetup.log`: Verifies SCCM client installation.
- `PolicyPV.log`: Tracks policy delivery and status.
- `CoManagementHandler.log`: Monitors workload management and transitions.

By following these guidelines and understanding the co-management architecture, administrators can effectively manage devices across both SCCM and Microsoft Intune platforms.
