Hello everyone,

Welcome to today's session, where we will discuss **Azure AD Connect**. This is a Level 100 video focusing on setting up Azure AD Connect and its significance in syncing on-premises identities to the cloud.

## Understanding Azure AD Connect
Azure AD Connect is a tool that enables synchronization between an on-prem Active Directory and Azure Active Directory (AAD). It allows users to maintain a **single identity** across both environments, improving user experience and security.

### Why Do We Need Azure AD Connect?
1. **Identity Synchronization**: Ensures that users have the same credentials in both on-prem and cloud environments.
2. **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Users log in once and gain access to both on-prem and cloud applications.
3. **Password Synchronization**: Syncs on-prem passwords to Azure AD, reducing the need for multiple credentials.
4. **Hybrid Identity**: Allows seamless access to cloud services like Microsoft 365, OneDrive, and SharePoint Online.

## Key Components of Azure AD Connect
- **Synchronization Service**: Handles syncing of user identities, groups, and devices.
- **Pass-Through Authentication (PTA)**: Authenticates users directly against on-prem AD without storing passwords in Azure.
- **Password Hash Synchronization (PHS)**: Syncs password hashes securely to Azure AD.
- **Federation Integration**: Works with AD FS for a consistent authentication experience.
- **Device Sync & Hybrid Azure AD Join**: Ensures devices are registered in both on-prem and Azure AD.
- **Health Monitoring**: Tracks sync status and detects potential issues.

## Azure AD Connect Installation Steps
### Prerequisites:
1. **Windows Server 2012 R2 or later**.
2. **An on-prem AD domain** with administrative access.
3. **Azure AD Global Administrator credentials**.
4. **Internet connectivity** for cloud sync.

### Installation Process:
1. **Download Azure AD Connect** from Microsoftâ€™s official site.
2. **Run the Installer** and select *Customize* for advanced options.
3. **Choose Authentication Method**:
   - **Password Hash Synchronization (PHS)**
   - **Pass-Through Authentication (PTA)**
   - **Federation with AD FS**
4. **Select the On-Prem Directory** and connect it to Azure AD.
5. **Configure Synchronization Options**:
   - **Sync All Users and Devices**
   - **Limit Sync to Specific Organizational Units (OUs)**
6. **Enable Hybrid Azure AD Join** if needed.
7. **Configure Optional Features**:
   - **Password Writeback**: Allows password resets from Azure AD to sync back to on-prem.
   - **Device Writeback**: Syncs cloud-registered devices to on-prem AD.
8. **Start Synchronization** and verify users in Azure AD.

## Understanding Hybrid Azure AD Join
Hybrid Azure AD Join enables on-prem domain-joined devices to be recognized in Azure AD, providing seamless access to cloud services.

### Steps to Enable Hybrid Azure AD Join:
1. **Enable Device Registration in Azure AD Connect**.
2. **Configure Service Connection Point (SCP)** in AD to let devices locate Azure AD.
3. **Verify Device Sync** in Azure AD.

## Password Writeback and Device Writeback
- **Password Writeback**: Enables users to reset their passwords in Azure AD, which syncs back to on-prem AD.
- **Device Writeback**: Ensures cloud-registered devices appear in on-prem AD for policy enforcement.

## Monitoring and Troubleshooting
- Use **Azure AD Connect Health** for real-time sync monitoring.
- Run **PowerShell Command** `Start-ADSyncSyncCycle` to force a manual sync.
- Check **Azure AD Audit Logs** for sync errors.
